This repository containd the Operating Lab codes for B.Tech CS in CUSAT. 
<b>Note : </b> It is highly advised that you practise creating the programs yourself and leaning how it works. This repository is meant to help if you are stuck/need a reference to understand from. 

The codes consist of the following:

1. C program to implement First Come First Serve (FCFS) cpu scheduling.
2. C program to demonstrate one-way pipe between parent and child process. Parent takes numbers from user and child lists the numbers back.
3. C program to demonstrate two-way pipe between parent and child process. Parent takes numbers from user and child displays the sum of the numbers back.
4. C program to use pipelines to scan string inputs for palindromes and count and display the palindromes found
5. C program to implement Round Robin (RR) cpu scheduling.
6. C program to implement Shortest Job First (SJF) cpu scheduling (non-preemptive).
7. C program to implement Shortest Job First (SJF) cpu scheduling (preemptive).
